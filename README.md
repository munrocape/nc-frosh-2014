#New College Frosh 2014 Website
This is an archive of the website used for the 2014 edition of New College's Orientation Week. New College is one of the seven colleges that comprise the University of Toronto in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

While the site was taken down following the frosh week, it has been rehosted for posterity [on GitHub pages](http://munrocape.github.io/nc-frosh-2014/).

In particular, the landing page was based off of the [Counter coming soon page](http://www.blacktie.co/2014/03/counter-coming-soon-page/). I added some buttons to proceed to the main frosh page or to sign up.

The main frosh page was a modified version of the [Shield theme](http://www.blacktie.co/2014/02/shield-one-page-theme/). I changed up the ordering of sections, the images, and content. This was my first exposure and experience with bootstrap and I used this theme as the scaffolding for which to build and modify.
