					<p style="text-align:center;">Hey everyone! We are this year’s Orientation Week Co-Chairs and we are so excited to be able to introduce you to your new home on campus. U of T is a big place filled with lots opportunities and we are here to make sure you know where to find everything that you need in order to make the best of your time at U of T. This year’s theme for Orientation is CarGNUval (pronounced car-NEW-val) and is a celebration of the diversity that we are so proud of at New College!<br><br>Frosh Week takes place the week before classes start in the fall and is a week filled with activities that prepare you for your life at U of T. This summer, we are working with a team of over 150 upper-year students to make sure that Orientation provides you with all of the tools that you need for your years ahead. Throughout the week you’ll be grouped with students in your program and with two awesome leaders who will be able to answer all of your questions about student life from how to manage stress and the best study habits to where to buy food late and how to get involved on campus. Buy your Frosh Kit and stay connected with us online for more updates as they come throughout the summer. We can’t wait to meet you in September!<br><br>Gnuly yours,<br>Herun and Sophia</p>

					<p style="text-align:center;">Orientation Week, sometimes called Frosh Week, happens the week before the academic year starts at the University of Toronto. It’s your introduction to university life, socially, academically, and culturally.It’s where you meet your best friend or your roommates of the present and future. It’s where you learn how to deal with the trials of university, and where to go if you need help. Most importantly, Frosh tells you where your home is and always will be.</p>
					<h3 class="centered"><p>With that being said, welcome to New College! This is Frosh 2014.</p></h3>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What is Frosh Week?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Frosh Week happens the week before the academic year starts at the University of Toronto. It’s your introduction to university life, socially, academically, and culturally. Best friends, future roommates, classroom tips, come here to learn it all!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Will there be alcohol?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">No! We will not be providing you with alcohol.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Is Frosh Week worth it?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Definitely! This is going to be the best week of your undergraduate life. Also, it’s a great way to instantly make friends and know the ins and outs of campus and school life!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What if I can't afford it?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">You can get financial aid through the New College Registrar Office. Go to their office or email them at newcollege.registrar@utoronto.ca. Alternatively, refer to <a href="http://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/current-students/newly-admitted-students/first-year-checklist/new-college-orientation/">this link.</a></p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What is FLC?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Called First Year Learning Communities, it groups together 24 students in the same area of study, guided by a Peer Mentor and Assistant Peer Mentor, for the entirety of first year. Registration closes on July 16! Go to http://flc.utoronto.ca/ to sign up.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Do I have to go to every event?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">While we do recommend you go to every event, of course you don’t have to. But going to all the events gives you the full experience of Frosh Week, as well as New College and the rest of campus. Plus, let’s be honest, free food AND free stuff is a combination you don’t want to miss. Especially when there’s the possibility that you meet someone awesome just 5 minutes later.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Accessibility Services</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Yes! Our registration form will have that option. We take it seriously, and every event is designed to be fully accessible. If you have any concerns, please email us at frosh@ncsc.ca, and we can go over our services in detail.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What if I don't know anyone?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> Don’t worry! Everyone is in the same boat! Start with a simple “Hey, my name is” and you should be fine. If you’re super concerned about not knowing anyone, we’re going to put you in small groups first so that you can be more comfortable.</p>


					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Will there be food at events?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> Yep! Check our schedule, with a few exceptions, we’ve got you for lunch and dinner every day. Our schedule should be updated with specific meals during the summer.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>I have allergies/dietary restrictions, are you going to take that into account?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> Of course! We fully accommodate for allergies and dietary restrictions. Make sure you fill out this section of your registration form.</p>


				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 centered">
					
					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What's a Frosh Kit?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> The physical goodies from Frosh. It contains everything from waterbottles to spirit gear to clipboards. When you buy it, you’re buying your entrance to Frosh Week, and a way to understand the new world you’re about to enter. Trust, go read our testimonials, we’re not kidding.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Where do I get a Frosh Kit?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> <a href="http://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/registration/orientation_2014">You can buy one on this website!</a> Alternatively, click the button called “Sign Up Now!”. You can also come to our office at 45 Willcocks St. Rm 100. Enter from the ground floor, walk past the elevators, we’re hidden behind the staircase.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Do I have to get a Frosh Kit?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> In order to participate in New College Frosh Week, you need a Frosh Kit.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What's in a Frosh Kit?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> As far as we know, Lanyard, T-shirt, Sunglasses, Water bottles, Clipboard, Surprise Spirit Gear, Temporary Tattoos. We got a lot more stuff coming!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What's the difference between signing up and purchasing a Frosh Kit?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> There is no difference! You sign up by purchasing a Frosh Kit.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>My faculty wants me to buy their Frosh Kit. Should I?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Buy ours, not theirs. We have the best orientation week on campus, no exceptions. </p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What should I bring to Frosh Week?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> We’re going to have a t-shirt for you, but bring clothes that you’re comfortable in. That includes shoes! We’re going to be doing a lot of things where you’re on your feet. We have an event midway through the week where the dress code is semi formal, so get a classy outfit ready. Otherwise, dress for the weather! Don’t forget sunscreen! Last thing you need is emergency money, we’ll provide transportation to every event, but some cash on hand is always useful in an emergency.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What should I not bring to Frosh Week?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> Large Bags! Laptops! Anything that you can’t carry around with you when you’re walking around all day. </p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Can I store any of my belongings?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> Lockers are available for the week. They are free, but require a $10 deposit which can be picked up at the end of the week at the New College Student Council office at 45 Willcocks St. They are limited and assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis. Commuters are recommended to get a locker (no seriously, you’ll want one), but remember to bring your own lock!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>How do I get around?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"> The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway and connecting bus/streetcar routes operate until approximately 1:00a.m. The closest subway stations to New College are Spadina station and St. George station (check map for details).  We will be providing TTC directions to and from our events, as well as information on cabs. For more information on the TTC, please visit www.ttc.ca.</p>

					<p>Orientation was the best week of my university career thus far! As an old New College Orientation Leader once told me, frosh is the one event during your years spent at UofT that you remember during your last day at Convocation.</p>

					<h4><b>Filippo Giliberti</b></h4>
					<p>Hello New Gnu College students! My name is Filippo and I think I'm among the biggest fans of Frosh. Wanna know why? The reason is simple... Frosh is AMAZING because it gives us the possibility to get out of our shells. Being a yellow t-shirt was the best experience I had so far and helped me to build the friendships I'll remember for all my life. So, you, new students, don't be afraid to wear your yellow t-shirt.  Don't be afraid to cheer with your leaders.  Don't be afraid to say "Hi!, what up?" to an other new Gnu student. This year I'm wearing the green t-shirt, so I'm on the other side, trying to inspire you, trying to make you dance, trying to make you smile all week long. So if you see me around just say "Ciao Filippo! Che fai?". </p>

					<h4><b>Katrina Chiu</b></h4>
					<p>I can still remember everything I felt the first morning of Frosh – apprehensive (had I, by some miracle, picked the right college at random?), jetlagged (having flown in to Toronto the day before on a 15 hour flight), and lonely (not knowing a single face in a sea of yellow frosh shirts). By the end of the week, every anxious thought and uneasy feeling I had dissipated entirely. The very same strangers in yellow shirts became future fellow frosh leaders and good friends to this day. All traces of homesickness vanished as quickly as my voice did in every event that were as equally engaging as they were exhausting. From my experiences solely based on Orientation, I knew I had done right by choosing to be a part of New College and its incredibly supportive, dynamic community.</p>

					<h4><b>Emma Lawrence</b></h4>
					<p>Frosh Week was an amazing experience for me. It really brought me out of my shell. I've always been fairly shy, but I quickly found a group of friends in the first few days of Frosh. Getting all decked out in New College colours and paint made me feel like a part of something, and I was able to come out of my comfort zone, because chanting and making friends and being crazy was the cool thing to do. I'm so happy with my Frosh experience and it's made me want to go back as a Frosh Leader this year to help the next batch of NC students feel just as home as I am at U of T.</p>
